I would never want to see something like that to happen to the website, especially if we are going to be showing this to external companies. Imagine an executive in a company seeing the lines just go off the screen of this website. They would never want to sponsor us. Like imagine just walking into a board meeting, seeing a promising university website, looking at the ultilisation of threejs and then just seeing text on the navbar just go flying off the screen. I would immediately lose my mind, seeing something like that happen. Such a beginner rookie mistake. The author of the website would be so embarrassed. They should never make a website again. Especially one that uses a navbar to display text that may potentially go off the screen. They should never go anywhere next frontend development again. ",
